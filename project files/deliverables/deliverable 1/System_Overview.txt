System Overview

Mytinerary is a web application designed to create, adjust and optimize the schedules of Concordia students. The schedule is created by the students who add courses offered by their respective program. Prior to the creation of the schedule, the user must select the according school term. In addition, the program will check whether or not the students have the correct pre or co-requisites prior to adding the class to the schedule. What this program differs from the current Concordia schedule making, is the friendly user interface. One major example is that it displays what the current schedule looks like while the student adds courses. The reason behind this is that the student can add courses while viewing their available schedule times rather than going back and forth viewing what time space is free. The application will also prohibit students from adding courses that is out of their course sequence or do not possess the correct pre/co-requisite.
This application is also usable by teachers alike. Teachers can post their term schedule which includes the courses being taught or their free hours. This is viewed by the students who then join the course.
